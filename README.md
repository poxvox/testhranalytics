# Predicting and Analyzing Employee Attrition Risk through Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization of HR Data, and Machine Learning Algorithms

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Pip package manager installed

### Installation Steps
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project_directory`
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    - For Windows: 
        - `python -m venv myenv`
        - `myenv\Scripts\activate`
    - For macOS/Linux:
        - `python3 -m venv myenv`
        - `source myenv/bin/activate`
3. Install project dependencies:
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Code

1. Ensure your dataset is located in the project directory or update the dataset path in the code.
    - Dataset path in Jupyter Notebook: `dataset_path = 'HR-Employee-Attrition.csv'`
2. Activate the virtual environment if not already activated:
    - For Windows: `myenv\Scripts\activate`
    - For macOS/Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    - `jupyter notebook`
4. Access the notebook in your browser and open `code.ipynb`.
5. Run individual cells in the notebook using `Shift + Enter`.
